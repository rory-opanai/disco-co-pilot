Budget alignment questions and patterns:

- Confirm budget owner and approval thresholds.
- Clarify phased rollout vs. single purchase.
- Tie budget to measurable outcomes.

Signals of risk:
- Vague budget ranges, no executive sponsor, or fiscal-year constraints.

Recommended NBQ patterns:
- "What budget range has been approved for this initiative?"
- "Who needs to sign off on this spend, and by when?"
